# Slack Action Version Fix

## Issue
The GitHub workflows were failing because they referenced an invalid version of the Slack action:
```yaml
uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v4  # ❌ v4 does not exist
```

## Solution
Updated all workflow files to use the correct version:
```yaml
uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3  # ✅ v3 is the latest stable version
```

## Files Updated
1. ✅ `.github/workflows/security-scanning.yml`
2. ✅ `.github/workflows/canary-deployment.yml`
3. ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
4. ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
5. ✅ `.github/workflows/performance-gates.yml`
6. ✅ `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml`
7. ✅ `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml`

## Verification
- ❌ No instances of `@v4` found in any workflow files
- ✅ All 7 workflow files now use `@v3`
- ✅ Action resolution errors should be resolved

## Action Repository
- Repository: https://github.com/8398a7/action-slack
- Latest stable version: v3
- v4 was never released as a stable version

## Result
All Slack notification steps in the workflows will now function correctly without action resolution errors.
