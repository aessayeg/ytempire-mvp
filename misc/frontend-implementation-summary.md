## Integration Points

### API Integration Requirements
All new components are ready for backend integration:
1. Video Editor needs `/api/v1/videos/edit` endpoint
2. Bulk Operations needs batch endpoints for each operation type
3. Performance Dashboard connects to `/api/v1/performance/` endpoints
4. Theme preference can be stored in user profile

### State Management
Components use existing stores:
- `authStore` - Authentication state
- `videoStore` - Video management
- `optimizedStore` - Performance optimizations

### WebSocket Integration
Real-time features ready for WebSocket events:
- Video processing progress
- Bulk operation progress
- Performance metrics updates

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Required
1. Theme switching logic
2. Lazy loading retry mechanism
3. Bulk selection logic
4. Video trim calculations

### Integration Tests
1. Theme persistence across sessions
2. Route lazy loading performance
3. Bulk operations with real API
4. Video editor with actual video files

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial load time: Target < 3s
- Time to Interactive: Target < 5s
- Bundle size: Target < 500KB (gzipped)
- Lighthouse score: Target > 90

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Performance audit with Lighthouse
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)

### Build Optimization
- [ ] Enable source maps for production debugging
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Set up service worker caching
- [ ] Enable HTTP/2 push for critical resources

### Monitoring Setup
