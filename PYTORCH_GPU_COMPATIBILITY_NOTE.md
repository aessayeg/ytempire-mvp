# PyTorch GPU Compatibility Note

## Current Status
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090
- **CUDA Capability**: sm_120
- **PyTorch Version**: 2.6.0+cu124
- **Status**: Functional with compatibility warning

## Issue
The RTX 5090 has CUDA capability sm_120, which is newer than what the current PyTorch build officially supports (up to sm_90). While PyTorch can still detect and use the GPU, you may see compatibility warnings.

## Current Functionality
✅ GPU is detected by PyTorch
✅ CUDA memory allocation works
✅ Basic inference operations function
⚠️ Compatibility warning appears but doesn't prevent operation

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Continue with Current Setup (Recommended for MVP)
The current setup is functional for development and testing. The compatibility warning doesn't prevent GPU operations.

### Option 2: Build PyTorch from Source (For Production)
When moving to production, consider building PyTorch from source with sm_120 support:
```bash
# Instructions for building PyTorch with RTX 5090 support
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch
# Set CUDA architecture
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="5.0;6.0;6.1;7.0;7.5;8.0;8.6;9.0;12.0"
python setup.py install
```

### Option 3: Wait for Official Support
Monitor PyTorch releases for official RTX 5090 support at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## Impact on YTEmpire MVP
- **Development**: No impact - current setup works for all development needs
- **Testing**: Can proceed with full GPU acceleration
- **Production**: Consider building from source or using cloud GPUs with full support

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check GPU availability
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Check GPU details
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"

# Test GPU computation
python -c "import torch; x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda(); print('GPU compute test passed')"
```
