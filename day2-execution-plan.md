## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers & Solutions

1. **Docker networking issues**

   - Fallback: Run services locally

2. **Database connection problems**
   - Solution: Check credentials and ports
   - Fallback: Use SQLite for development

3. **GPU driver issues**
   - Solution: Use CPU mode temporarily
   - Fallback: Use cloud GPU instances

4. **API contract mismatches**
   - Solution: 2 PM integration session
   - Fallback: Mock endpoints

5. **Celery not processing tasks**
   - Solution: Check Redis connection
   - Fallback: Synchronous processing
