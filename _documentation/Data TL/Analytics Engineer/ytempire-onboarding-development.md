WHERE date_key = (SELECT date_key FROM analytics.dim_date WHERE full_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1)
LIMIT 100;

-- Check data freshness
SELECT 
    table_name,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_update,
    NOW() - MAX(timestamp) as data_age
FROM (
    SELECT 'fact_video_performance' as table_name, MAX(timestamp) as timestamp 
    FROM analytics.fact_video_performance
    UNION ALL

    SUM(total_cost_cents) / 100.0 as total_cost,
    SUM(total_cost_cents) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT video_id), 0) / 100.0 as avg_cost_per_video,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(total_cost_cents) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT video_id), 0) > 300 THEN 'OVER_BUDGET'
        WHEN SUM(total_cost_cents) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT video_id), 0) > 250 THEN 'WARNING'
        ELSE 'OK'
    END as budget_status

WHERE cost_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(cost_timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Channel performance summary
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW analytics.v_channel_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.channel_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT v.video_key) as video_count,
    SUM(vp.views) as total_views,
    AVG(vp.engagement_rate) as avg_engagement,
    SUM(r.total_revenue_cents) / 100.0 as revenue,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(r.total_revenue_cents) DESC) as revenue_rank
FROM analytics.dim_channel c
LEFT JOIN analytics.dim_video v ON c.channel_id = v.channel_id
LEFT JOIN analytics.fact_video_performance vp ON v.video_key = vp.video_key
LEFT JOIN analytics.fact_revenue r ON v.video_key = r.video_key
WHERE vp.timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY c.channel_name;
