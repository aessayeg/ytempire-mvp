SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT video_id) as videos_published,
    SUM(revenue_cents) / 100.0 as total_revenue,
    AVG(revenue_cents) / 100.0 as avg_revenue_per_video,
    SUM(cost_cents) / 100.0 as total_cost,
    (SUM(revenue_cents) - SUM(cost_cents)) / 100.0 as profit
FROM video_metrics
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- 2. Channel Performance Ranking
CREATE VIEW channel_performance AS
SELECT 
    c.channel_name,
    COUNT(v.video_id) as video_count,
    SUM(v.views) as total_views,
    AVG(v.engagement_rate) as avg_engagement,
    SUM(v.revenue_cents) / 100.0 as total_revenue,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(v.revenue_cents) DESC) as revenue_rank
FROM channels c
JOIN videos v ON c.channel_id = v.channel_id
WHERE v.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY c.channel_id, c.channel_name;
```
