## 11.2 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### API Issues

```yaml
Issue: API returns 500 error
Solutions:
  - Check logs: docker-compose logs api
  - Verify database connection
  - Check environment variables
  - Review recent code changes
  - Restart services

Issue: Slow API response times
Solutions:
  - Check database query performance
  - Review Redis cache hit rates
  - Monitor CPU and memory usage
  - Enable query optimization
  - Add database indexes

Issue: Authentication failures
Solutions:
  - Verify JWT secret key
  - Check token expiration
  - Clear browser cookies
  - Verify user credentials
  - Check database connection
```

#### Database Issues

```sql
-- Check database connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, calls, mean
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT
    relname AS "table",
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS "size"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;

-- Fix connection issues
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle'
AND query_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes';

-- Vacuum and analyze
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

#### YouTube API Issues

```python
# Common YouTube API errors and fixes

YOUTUBE_ERROR_FIXES = {
    "quotaExceeded": {
        "error": "Daily quota limit reached",
        "solution": "Switch to reserve account or wait until midnight PT"
    },
    "forbidden": {
        "error": "Permission denied",
        "solution": "Check OAuth tokens and refresh if expired"
    },
    "videoNotFound": {
        "error": "Video does not exist",
        "solution": "Verify video ID and check if video was deleted"
    },
    "uploadLimitExceeded": {
        "error": "Too many uploads",
        "solution": "Distribute uploads across multiple accounts"
    },
    "processingFailed": {
        "error": "Video processing failed",
        "solution": "Check video format and retry upload"
    }
}

# Debug YouTube quota usage
def check_youtube_quota():
    for account in youtube_accounts:
        print(f"Account {account.id}:")
        print(f"  Quota used: {account.quota_used}/10000")
        print(f"  Uploads today: {account.uploads_today}/5")
        print(f"  Last reset: {account.last_reset}")
```

#### External Service Issues

```yaml
OpenAI API:
  Rate Limited:
    - Use GPT-3.5 as fallback
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Cache common responses
  
  Timeout:
    - Reduce max_tokens
    - Simplify prompts
    - Use streaming responses

ElevenLabs:
  Character Limit:
    - Split text into chunks
    - Use batch processing
    - Optimize script length
  
  Voice Quality:
    - Adjust voice settings
    - Try different voices
    - Check audio format

Stripe:
  Payment Failed:
    - Check card details
    - Verify API keys
    - Review webhook logs
  
  Webhook Issues:
    - Verify endpoint URL
    - Check signature verification
    - Review webhook events
```
