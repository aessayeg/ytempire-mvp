## Critical Alignment & Scope Definition

### MVP vs Future Vision Clarification

```yaml
mvp_reality_12_weeks:
  team_size: 4 people (Frontend Team Lead + 3 direct reports)
  users: 50 beta users
  channels_per_user: 5 channels
  total_channels: 250 (50 × 5)
  video_generation:
    daily_per_user: 1 video (rotated across their 5 channels)
    total_daily: 50 videos
    initial_launch: 5 videos per user (1 per channel on day 1)
  platform: Desktop-only (1280px minimum)
  updates: Polling-based (60-second intervals)
  
future_vision_post_mvp:
  phase_2: 10 channels/user, mobile responsive
  phase_3: 100+ channels/user, real-time updates
  note: "Any reference to 100+ channels, 1000+ users, or WebSockets is FUTURE, not MVP"
```

### Technology Stack (MVP ONLY)

```yaml
mvp_technology_final:
  framework: React 18 with TypeScript
  state: Zustand (NOT Redux)
  routing: React Router v6
  styling: Tailwind CSS
  charts: Recharts ONLY (NOT D3.js or Plotly)
  data: React Query
  forms: React Hook Form
  
explicitly_not_in_mvp:

  - Plotly
  - Chart.js (except what Recharts uses internally)
  - WebSockets
  - WebGL
  - Canvas API (direct usage)
  - Web Workers
  - Server-Sent Events

### State Management (Zustand ONLY)

```typescript
// Simple Zustand store - NO Redux patterns
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface AppState {
  // Data (limited scope)
  user: User | null;
  channels: Channel[];      // Max 5
  videos: Video[];          // Recent 100
  costs: CostData;
  
  // Actions (simple)
  fetchChannels: () => Promise<void>;
  generateVideo: (channelId: string) => Promise<void>;
  updateCosts: () => void;
}

// NOT implementing:
// - Redux Toolkit
// - Complex middleware
// - Normalized state
// - Redux DevTools
```

### Chart Implementation (Recharts ONLY)

```typescript
// Using Recharts exclusively
import { 
  LineChart, 
  BarChart, 
  PieChart, 
  AreaChart 
} from 'recharts';

// MVP charts (5-7 total)
const charts = {
  channelPerformance: LineChart,
  costBreakdown: PieChart,
  videoMetrics: BarChart,
  revenuetrends: AreaChart
};

// NOT using:
// - D3.js
// - Plotly
// - Chart.js (direct)
// - Canvas API
// - WebGL
// - Custom visualizations
```

### Update Strategy (Polling ONLY)

```typescript
// Simple polling - NO WebSockets
const POLLING_INTERVALS = {
  dashboard: 60000,     // 1 minute
  videoStatus: 5000,    // 5 seconds (during generation)
  costs: 30000,         // 30 seconds
};

// Using React Query for polling
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['dashboard'],
  queryFn: fetchDashboard,
  refetchInterval: POLLING_INTERVALS.dashboard,
});

// NOT implementing:
// - WebSocket connections
// - Server-Sent Events  
// - Real-time updates
// - Live data streams
```

## Budget Reality Check

### Frontend Team Costs (3 months)
```yaml
realistic_estimates:
  frontend_lead: $45,000 ($15K/month)
  react_engineer: $36,000 ($12K/month)
  dashboard_specialist: $36,000 ($12K/month)
  ui_ux_designer: $30,000 ($10K/month)
  
  frontend_total: $147,000
  
budget_context:
  total_project_budget: $200,000
  total_team_size: 17 people
  
  issue: "Frontend alone would consume 73.5% of total budget"
  status: "Acknowledged - requires executive resolution"
  options:
    - Increase total budget
    - Reduce team size
    - Shorten timeline
    - Adjust salary expectations
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Scope creep to 100+ channels | HIGH | Document says 5 channels only | Team Lead |
| Mobile feature requests | HIGH | Desktop-only clearly communicated | All |
| Complex viz demands | MEDIUM | Recharts only, no D3.js | Dashboard Spec |
| Redux complexity added | LOW | Zustand decision is final | React Engineer |
| Component explosion | MEDIUM | 30-40 component limit enforced | React Engineer |
| WebSocket requests | MEDIUM | Polling only for MVP | Dashboard Spec |

---

## Cross-Team Collaboration

- Authentication flow (JWT)
- Error handling standards
- Polling intervals coordination

### With Platform Ops
- Local deployment setup
- Performance monitoring
- Security reviews (OWASP top 10)
- QA test coordination

### With AI Team

- Performance metrics needed
- API response expectations
- Error handling for AI failures

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup (15 min)
```markdown
Format:
1. Yesterday (2 min/person max)
2. Today (1 min/person max)
3. Blockers (discuss after if needed)
4. Scope creep alerts (immediate flag)
```

### Weekly Team Meeting (1 hour)
```markdown
Agenda:
1. Sprint progress (15 min)
2. Design review (15 min)
3. Technical decisions (15 min)
4. Cross-team dependencies (15 min)
```

## Final Clarifications

### This is the MVP Brief (12 Weeks)
1. **4-person team** (Lead + 3 members)
2. **3 direct reports** (not 5)
3. **1 React Engineer** (not 2)
4. **1 UI/UX Designer** (not 2)
5. **5 channels per user** (not 100+)
6. **50 beta users** (not 1000+)
7. **Desktop-only** (not mobile)
8. **Zustand only** (not Redux)
9. **Recharts only** (not D3.js)
10. **Polling only** (not WebSockets)

### Future Phases (NOT in this brief)
- Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Mobile responsive, 10 channels
- Phase 3 (Year 2): 100+ channels, real-time, D3.js
- Phase 4 (Year 3): Enterprise features, 1000+ users

## Conclusion

The Frontend Team has a clear, achievable mission: Build a simple, desktop-only web interface in 12 weeks for 50 beta users to manage 5 YouTube channels each.

**Every feature request should be evaluated against:**
1. Is it essential for 5-channel management?
2. Can it be built by 4 people in 12 weeks?
3. Does it work with Zustand/Recharts/Polling?
4. Is it desktop-only?

If any answer is "no", it's not MVP scope.

Let's build what we can actually deliver!
