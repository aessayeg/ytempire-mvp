# 9. ROADMAPS & TIMELINES

## Overview

### MVP Vision Statement
**YTEMPIRE's MVP solves the fundamental problem that 95% of aspiring content creators fail because they can't maintain consistent, quality output while managing the business side of YouTube. Our primary user is the digital entrepreneur who has $2,000-$5,000 to invest in building passive income but lacks the time or technical skills to manage YouTube channels manually. The single most important outcome we're targeting is proving that one person can profitably operate 5+ YouTube channels simultaneously with less than 1 hour of weekly oversight, generating $10,000+ in monthly revenue within 90 days.**

### Core MVP Constraints
- **Team Size**: 17 people across 5 teams
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks to beta launch
- **Users**: 50 beta users initially
- **Channels**: 5 channels maximum per user
- **Automation**: 95% hands-off operation
- **Cost Target**: <$0.50 per video
- **Bundle Size**: <1MB (hard limit)
- **Components**: 30-40 maximum
- **Screens**: 20-25 total
- **Charts**: 5-7 Recharts only (NO D3.js)
- **Desktop Only**: 1280px minimum width (NO mobile for MVP)
