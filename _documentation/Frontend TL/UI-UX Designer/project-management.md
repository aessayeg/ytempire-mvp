## 6.4 Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Bundle size >1MB** | High | High | Aggressive code splitting, tree shaking | Remove MUI for critical components |
| **API delays** | Medium | Critical | Parallel development with mocks | Extend timeline by 1 week |
| **Cost per video >$3** | Medium | High | Optimize API calls, cache aggressively | Reduce video quality/length |
| **User onboarding failure** | Low | High | Extensive testing, clear documentation | Provide manual onboarding support |
| **Performance degradation** | Medium | High | Continuous monitoring, optimization sprints | Reduce feature scope |
| **Security breach** | Low | Critical | Security audits, penetration testing | Incident response plan ready |
| **YouTube API changes** | Low | Critical | Monitor API changelog, version pinning | Quick patch deployment process |
| **Team member loss** | Medium | Medium | Knowledge sharing, documentation | Cross-training, contractor backup |
| **Scope creep** | High | Medium | Strict change control, clear MVP definition | Push features to Phase 2 |
| **Budget overrun** | High | High | Weekly budget tracking, resource optimization | Reduce team size or timeline |
