## Test Automation Strategy

### Automation Pyramid
```
         /\
        /  \  5% - Manual Exploratory
       /    \
      /  UI  \  15% - E2E UI Tests
     /________\
    /          \  30% - Integration Tests
   /  Service   \
  /______________\
 /                \  50% - Unit Tests
/      Unit        \
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
Pipeline Stages:
  1. Commit Stage (5 min):
     - Linting
     - Unit tests
     - Security scan
     
  2. Build Stage (10 min):
     - Docker build
     - Integration tests
     - Code coverage
     
  3. Test Stage (15 min):
