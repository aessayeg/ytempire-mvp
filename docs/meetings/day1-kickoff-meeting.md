## 3. AI Strategy & Cost Model (VP of AI)

### Cost Breakdown Target (<$3/video)
```
Script Generation (GPT-3.5): $0.50
Voice Synthesis (ElevenLabs): $1.00
Image Generation: $0.50
Video Processing: $0.50
Background Music: $0.30
Infrastructure/Other: $0.20
--------------------------------
TOTAL: $3.00 per video
```

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Model Selection**: Default to GPT-3.5, upgrade to GPT-4 only for premium
2. **Caching**: Reuse common elements (music, images, voice segments)
3. **Batch Processing**: Group API calls for efficiency
4. **Fallback Services**: Google TTS when ElevenLabs quota exceeded
5. **Local Processing**: Use local models when possible

### Initial API Credits
- OpenAI: $5,000 allocated
- ElevenLabs: $500 allocated
- Google Cloud: $300 free tier
- Total Week 0 Budget: $33,000
