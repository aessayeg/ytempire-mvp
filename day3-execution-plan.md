4. **Real-time Data Flow** - WebSocket reliability

### Mitigation Strategies
- Parallel development where possible
- Incremental testing approach
- Clear integration contracts
- Fallback options for critical paths

### Escalation Path
1. Task-level issues → Team Lead (15 minutes)
2. Team-level blockers → CTO (30 minutes) 
3. Cross-team conflicts → CTO + Product Owner (1 hour)
4. Resource constraints → CEO (2 hours)
